Welcome to Project Astra, a user-friendly information tool about our universe. 


(For text-based)(Updated as of 02/24/2020)
  To effectively run this program, the following files are needed on your computer
          -Main.java  <-- The file you must run for later
          -Universe.java
          -Planet.java
          -Earth.java
          -Countries.java
          -Grid.java
          -Galaxy.java
          -MilkyWay.java
          -Stars.java
          
          
          **The above files must all be on one directory together.
          
 Next, open up your command prompt, and go to the directory with the above files in it. Then type in "javac *.java"
 There should be no compilation errors, if there are then you are missing some files, go back to the first step and make sure you've downloaded all the correct files.
 
 Once you have compiled the files correctly without error, type in "java Main". And you should see a title page of our program.
 
  How to use our program (For textbased) Updated as of 02/24/2020

  You will be prompted with a title page, press any key to advance. Then you will be displayed with Menu options, navigate through them by typing the exact keyword displayed by the menu option in order to access it. This is an information tool, so navigating to a specific object will give you information about that object.
  
    By now it should ask "What galaxy do you want to explore?"
                        There is only one keyword that will work to advance, : "Milky Way". As the Andromeda class is not set up yet.
                        
    Next it will ask what objects you want to explore in the galaxy:
              Available key words: "Planets" , "Stars" 
              If you chose "Stars", it should display a menu of buttons including the sun and other stars.
              If you chose "Planets" in the scanner, it should display a menu of all the planets in our current solar system.
              Only one keyword works currently 
                    "Earth" - Typing earth will display information about earth.
                    
              There is no way to go back from menus as it has not been implemented yet, but will be fixed soon.
