Welcome to Project Astra, a user-friendly information tool about our universe.

(For GUI)(Updated as of 03/12/2020) To effectively compile and run this program, the following files are needed on your computer -GUIApp.java <-- The file you must run for later -Universe.java -PlanetsGUI.java -CountriesGUI.java -EarthGUI.java -GalaxyMenuGUI.java -MilkyWayGUI.java -StarsGUI.java -VenusDisplay.java. You also need the logic package which contains the files from the text based version of our project. 

** You must use eclipse for java developers and have your packages (GUI,LogicClasses) in the right directory or you will face compilation errors.

(For Eclipse)
Make sure you create a new java project, you can name it whatever you want. Them import all the files/packages to your src code.
To run the program, right click on the "GUIApp.java" class and follow this directory : Run as -> Java Application. If you face compilation errors, you are missing files, refer to the above to make sure you have all the files.



Using the GUI app:
      When using our app, the following buttons may not be functional (Nothing happens when you click on them): 
       Andromeda,Mercury,Mars,Jupiter,Saturn,Neptune and all the buttons from the Stars menu.
       
  That aside: To use our program navigate through by clicking on specific buttons (such as Milky Way).
  When you click on the Milky Way button, you will be prompted with a search bar. This is where you search for certain objects in that specific galaxy. The text you put into that search bar will depend on the label and what it tells what you can or cannot search.
