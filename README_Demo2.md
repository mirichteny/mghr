Welcome to Project Astra, a user-friendly information tool about our universe.

(For GUI)(Updated as of 03/12/2020) To effectively compile and run this program, the following files are needed on your computer -GUIApp.java <-- The file you must run for later -Universe.java -PlanetsGUI.java -CountriesGUI.java -EarthGUI.java -GalaxyMenuGUI.java -MilkyWayGUI.java -StarsGUI.java -VenusDisplay.java. Pictures needed: "SpaceBackGround.jpg" You also need the logic package which contains the files from the text based version of our project. 

** You must use eclipse for java developers and have your packages (GUI,LogicClasses) in the right directory or you will face compilation errors.

(For Eclipse)
Make sure you create a new java project, you can name it whatever you want. Then import all the files/packages to your src code.
To run the program, right click on the "GUIApp.java" class and follow this directory : Run as -> Java Application. If you face compilation errors, you are missing files, refer to the above to make sure you have all the files.



Using the GUI app:
      When using our app, the following buttons may not be functional (Nothing happens when you click on them): 
       Andromeda, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and all the buttons from the Stars menu.
       There may also be problems with images not showing up.
  That aside: To use our program navigate through by clicking on specific buttons (such as Milky Way).
  When you click on the Milky Way button, you will be prompted with a search bar. This is where you search for certain objects in that specific galaxy. The text you put into that search bar will depend on the label and what it tells what you can or cannot search. Follow the instructions on the label below the search bar and you will come across different scenes depending on what you search. 
  If you search "Planets", a collection of buttons that have some planets as labels will show up. Depending on what you click, pop up menus may appear. And if those pop up menus appear, you may be stuck and cannot exit out of it, simply close the pop up menu if you want to access the main app again.
