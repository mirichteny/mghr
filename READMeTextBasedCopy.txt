Welcome to Project Astra, a user-friendly information tool about our universe. 


(For text-based)(Updated as of 04/15/2020)
  To effectively run this program, the following files are needed on your computer
          -TextBasedApp.java  <-- The file you must run for later
          -Universe.java
	  -Galaxy.java
	  -MilkyWay.java
	  -Earth.java
	  -Venus.java
          -Planets.java
          -Grid.java
          -Stars.java
          

          
          **The above files must all be on one directory together.
**For command prompt**          
 Next, open up your command prompt, and go to the directory with the above files in it. Then type in "javac *.java"
 There should be no compilation errors, if there are then you are missing some files, go back to the first step and make sure you've downloaded all the correct files.
 
 Once you have compiled the files correctly without error, type in "java TextBasedApp". And you should see a title page of our program.
 
  How to use our program (For textbased) Updated as of 04/06/2020

  You will be prompted with a title page, press any key to advance. Then you will be displayed with Menu options, navigate through them by typing the exact keyword displayed by the menu option in order to access it. 
  
    By now, you should see two menu buttons , Milky Way and Andromeda (Andromeda does not work so typing andromeda will cause problems for now)
                        There is only one keyword that will work to advance, : "Milky Way". 
                        
    Next it will ask what objects you want to explore in the galaxy:
              Available key words: "Planets" , "Stars" 
              If you chose "Stars", it should display a menu of buttons including the sun and other stars. (Only the menu will display but no information will return to you if you choose one oof the options)
              If you chose "Planets" in the scanner, it should display a menu of all the planets in our current solar system.
	      Choosing a planet will output information about said planet to the console.
              
                    
              There is no back button command (but you can go to a specific menu by typing in the keyword for that menu button).
